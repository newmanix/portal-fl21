        <h1>Hybrid workplace model</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
        <p>A hybrid workplace model is a model that mixes on-premise and remote workplace models to offer a more flexible <br>
            environment to employees. It can be almost entirely remote, with employees attending regular face-to-face<br>
            meetings. It can also be where employees alternate time in the office with some remote work. A hybrid<br>
            workplace provides the employees with a better work-life balance that has more engagement. Moreover, <br>
            employers benefit from a hybrid workplace by building a more productive and stable workforce.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
        <h2>The pros of hybrid jobs</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Lower operational costs</li>
            <p>In a hybrid work model, companies will experience a decrease in utility bills as they will not need as many<br>
             computers, printers, desks, and other office supplies. Especially, in expensive metro areas, companies can save<br>
             a significant amount of money on real estate expenses by implementing this work model. The hybrid work model will<br>
              benefit the employees as well by creating an opportunity for them to spend less on daily commutes and other<br> 
              workplace-related expenses.</p>
            
            <li>Increased productivity</li>
            <p>A hybrid model boosts productivity by offering flexibility in a way that empowers employees to work to their<br>
               strengths. In a hybrid work model, companies can encourage a culture that views the remote component of this<br>
               work model as a positive option for completing deep-focus tasks. This working model is important to increase<br>
               productivity by creating the opportunity for employees to have their own personal space and time to focus on<br>
               their respective tasks. Additionally, there will be meetings in the office with teams for a good balance of<br>
               creativity and collaboration. </p>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>The cons of hybrid jobs</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Difficulty keeping up with hybrid schedules</li>
            <p>More variation in the schedules of a team can be mentioned as one of the challenges of the hybrid workplace<br>
               model; the flexibility that the model provides for each team member can lead to schedule conflict when<br>
               arranging team meetings. And, it can also be tough for employees that come on-site to know which of their<br>
               teammates will be available unless efficient tools are implemented. This can potentially lead to resourcing<br>
               issues. The use of different work plans such as <a href="https://envoy.com/blog/the-4-office-schedules-that-power-hybrid-work/#:~:text=1.,on%2Dsite%20Tuesday%20and%20Thursday.">cohort schedules</a>  or <a href="https://envoy.com/blog/the-4-office-schedules-that-power-hybrid-work/#:~:text=1.,on%2Dsite%20Tuesday%20and%20Thursday.">staggered schedules</a> along with the<br>
               creation of policies and guidelines around employee schedules will help avoid any frustration or confusion by<br>
               promoting a smooth, collaborative and creative work environment.</p>
    
            <li>Faster employee burnout </li>
            <p>In the remote component of this workplace model, employees may tend to feel guilty for taking a time off in<br>
               the afternoon which they overcompensate by working later. If the remote team is left unchecked, they could be<br>
               working longer hours and taking fewer breaks than the on-site teams in which case, the culture of burnout<br>
               might occur. Creating a culture where employees can take breaks when they are feeling overwhelmed will help<br>
               fight remote burnout. Also, setting up an office that is efficient,  productive, and delightful will help<br>
               reduce on-site burnout.</p>
