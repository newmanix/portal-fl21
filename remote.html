        <h1>Remote workplace model</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
        <p>Remote work is the practice of employees doing their jobs from a location other than a central office operated by the employer. Such locations could include an employee's home, a co-working or other shared space, a private office, or any other place outside of the traditional corporate office building or campus.</p>
    
        <h2>The pros of remote jobs</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Better work-life balance</li>
                <p>Working remotely means that you can spend more time with your family. Additionally, it is possible to create a schedule that can help you achieve the perfect balance between work and personal life. Not commuting to work means that you can save a significant amount of time. Thus, you can utilize these saved hours to have some quality time with your partner and kids.</p>
    
            <li>Saving more on the commute and less carbon footprint</li>
                <p>Just imagine, all the bills that you pay for your transportation, parking tickets, vehicle maintenance, eating lunch in a fancy restaurant, etc. cease to exist. All these savings become a reality when you are working remotely. By not commuting to work, you also reduce your carbon footprint as you will not be taking your vehicle out. Additionally, it will help you do your bit to save the environment and save fuel for the future.</p>    
        </ol>
    
        <h2>The cons of remote jobs</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Lack of social interaction</li>
                <p>It’s obvious that you are going to miss social interaction with the people in your organization. The lack of social interaction will affect you most if you are an extrovert or a social butterfly. Also, when you are working the whole day without talking to anyone, you are most likely to feel lonely. Thus, you need to put more effort to interact with people in your team and even have to take part in remote team-building activities.</p>
    
            <li>Communication Gap</li>
                <p>One of the most important things that are missing in a remote work arrangement is proper communication among colleagues. In the office, it’s so easy to approach any colleague whenever you want to discuss something in person. However, as a remote worker, you have to rely on instant messaging and video calls to communicate with your team members. While video conferencing can be a solution, it can never be as effective as talking to someone who is sitting right next to you. The absence of proper communication among remote teams is likely to act as a roadblock to effective team collaboration.</p>
