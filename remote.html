        <h1>Remote workplace model</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
        <p>There are many benefits to working from home from the time you can save to spend with family to the benefit of not commuting every morning. Deciding if remote is right for you is important to create a workspace where you feel not only comfortable where you are at, but motivated as. well.  Below we will talk about some advantages and disadvantages of remote work to help with deciding if you should go with this work model or if a different work model might be best for you by giving you the necessary information on what you want your work model to be.</p>
    
        <h2>The pros of remote jobs</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Better work-life balance</li>
                <p>Working remotely has the benefit of creating a better work-life balance. As you don't need to commute which can save you time. This can help with giving you more time to spend with friends and family, but also give you some time to work on other activities. Working remotely gives you the opportunity to save more time since commuting would not affect your schedule and can spend more time resting or even have the opportunity to spend your mornings with your family. 
                </p>
    
            <li>Saving more on the commute and less carbon footprint</li>
                <p>Commuting can be a big issue for some people, but imagine not having to deal with such a long commute. Being able to use that time can help with creating a better day for yourself to feel more motivated. There is also the benefit of not having to create a large carbon footprint as you want to drive as much and this will help with creating a better environment.</p>    
        </ol>
    
        <h2>The cons of remote jobs</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Lack of social interaction</li>
                <p>It’s obvious that you are going to miss social interaction with the people in your organization. The lack of social interaction will affect you most if you are an extrovert or a social butterfly. Also, when you are working the whole day without talking to anyone, you are most likely to feel lonely. Thus, you need to put more effort to interact with people in your team and even have to take part in remote team-building activities.</p>
    
            <li>Communication Gap</li>
                <p>One of the most important things that are missing in a remote work arrangement is proper communication among colleagues. In the office, it’s so easy to approach any colleague whenever you want to discuss something in person. However, as a remote worker, you have to rely on instant messaging and video calls to communicate with your team members. While video conferencing can be a solution, it can never be as effective as talking to someone who is sitting right next to you. The absence of proper communication among remote teams is likely to act as a roadblock to effective team collaboration.</p>
